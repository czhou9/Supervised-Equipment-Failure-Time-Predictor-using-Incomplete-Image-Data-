Use 'DataGeneration.m' to generate the complete 21*21*10*500 complete 4D tensor. The code for 'randomize the sequence' and 'generate missing entries'
are also in 'DataGeneration.m' and hided at the last.


Use 'TensorCompletion.m' to fill the missing entries for incomplete 4D tensor when verifying the two benchmarks 'MPCA', 'MPCA_CV'. 'Tmac' folder should
be included during tensor completion.


Use 'CV_benchmark.m', 'CV_proposed.m/CV_proposed_method2.m' to select the optimal parameter for 'MPCA_CV' and 'Proposed_CV', explanations in detail are
in the code. When you can use cluster to run your code, you can change some 'for' to 'parfor' to save your time, exact place are labeled in the code.


Use 'Benchmark_MPCA.m' to check 'MPCA', use 'Benchmark_MPCA_CV.m' to check 'MPCA_CV', use 'Proposed_CV.m' to check 'Proposed_CV', the output is the boxplot.


For you convenience of checking the result, we attached the sample complete/incomplete 4D tensor and 4D tensor after tensor completion (in the data file).
Because it will take some time for tensor completion process and generating different missing percentage. We also labeled the optimal parameter combination
in the 'MPCA_CV.m' and 'Proposed_CV.m' for our attached data because it will also take some time for optimal parameter selection.
